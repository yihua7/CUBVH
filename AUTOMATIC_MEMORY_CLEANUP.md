# Automatic GPU Memory Management in cuBVH

## Overview

Yes, the current cuBVH implementation **automatically clears GPU memory when variables die**. This is achieved through proper implementation of destructors and RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles.

## How It Works

### 1. **Python Level (`__del__` method)**
When a cuBVH object is destroyed in Python (goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted), the `__del__` method is called:

```python
def __del__(self):
    """Destructor to ensure GPU memory is freed."""
    try:
        self.free_memory()
    except:
        # Ignore errors during destruction
        pass
```

### 2. **C++ Level (`~GPUMemory` destructor)**
The underlying `GPUMemory` class has a proper destructor that frees CUDA memory:

```cpp
~GPUMemory() {
#ifndef __CUDA_ARCH__
    if (!m_owned || !m_data) {
        return;
    }
    
    try {
        free_memory();
        m_size = 0;
    } catch (std::runtime_error error) {
        // Error handling...
    }
#endif
}
```

### 3. **Automatic Cleanup Scenarios**

- **Variable goes out of scope**: When a cuBVH variable exits its scope, the destructor is automatically called
- **Function returns**: Local cuBVH variables are automatically cleaned up
- **Loop iterations**: cuBVH variables created in loops are cleaned up each iteration
- **Exception handling**: Memory is cleaned up even when exceptions occur

## Test Scripts

Three test scripts are provided to validate automatic memory cleanup:

### 1. `test_basic_cleanup.py` - Simple validation
```bash
python test_basic_cleanup.py
```
- Tests basic automatic cleanup when variables go out of scope
- Tests multiple instances in a loop
- Reports memory usage before and after

### 2. `test_simple_cleanup.py` - Focused testing
```bash
python test_simple_cleanup.py
```
- Comprehensive testing of automatic cleanup
- Tests nested scopes
- Memory stability analysis
- Detailed reporting

### 3. `test_automatic_cleanup.py` - Advanced testing
```bash
python test_automatic_cleanup.py
```
- Extensive test suite with multiple scenarios
- Exception handling tests
- Multi-device testing (if available)
- Performance analysis

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ **What SHOULD happen (automatic cleanup working):**

```python
# Memory is automatically freed when variables go out of scope
for i in range(1000):
    bvh = cubvh.cuBVH(vertices, triangles)  # Creates GPU memory
    # Use bvh...
    # GPU memory automatically freed at end of iteration

print("Memory usage should be stable")
```

### ❌ **What should NOT happen (if there were memory leaks):**

```python
# This would cause memory leaks if automatic cleanup didn't work
for i in range(1000):
    bvh = cubvh.cuBVH(vertices, triangles)  # Creates GPU memory
    # Use bvh...
    # Memory would accumulate without proper cleanup

print("Memory usage would grow continuously")
```

## Manual Cleanup (Optional)

While automatic cleanup should work, you can still manually free memory for fine-grained control:

```python
bvh = cubvh.cuBVH(vertices, triangles)
# Use bvh...

# Optional: manually free GPU memory
bvh.free_memory()
```

## Troubleshooting

### If automatic cleanup doesn't work:

1. **Check Python garbage collection:**
   ```python
   import gc
   gc.collect()  # Force garbage collection
   ```

2. **Check CUDA cache:**
   ```python
   torch.cuda.empty_cache()  # Clear CUDA cache
   ```

3. **Use manual cleanup:**
   ```python
   bvh.free_memory()  # Explicitly free memory
   ```

### Memory monitoring:
```python
def check_memory():
    allocated = torch.cuda.memory_allocated() / (1024 * 1024)  # MB
    print(f"GPU memory: {allocated:.2f} MB")

check_memory()  # Before creating BVH
bvh = cubvh.cuBVH(vertices, triangles)
check_memory()  # After creating BVH
del bvh
check_memory()  # After destroying BVH (should be back to initial)
```

## Implementation Details

The automatic cleanup is implemented through several mechanisms:

1. **Smart Pointers**: `std::shared_ptr` for managing BVH lifetime
2. **RAII**: GPU memory is tied to object lifetime
3. **Proper Copy/Move Semantics**: Ownership is correctly transferred
4. **Exception Safety**: Memory is freed even during exceptions

## Best Practices

1. **Let automatic cleanup work**: In most cases, just let variables go out of scope
2. **Use manual cleanup for long-running processes**: If you create many BVHs in a long-running process
3. **Monitor memory**: Use the test scripts to verify cleanup is working
4. **Force garbage collection**: Use `gc.collect()` if needed

## Validation

Run the test scripts to validate that automatic cleanup is working in your environment:

```bash
# Quick test
python test_basic_cleanup.py

# Comprehensive test  
python test_simple_cleanup.py

# Full test suite
python test_automatic_cleanup.py
```

All tests should report "PASSED" and show stable memory usage, confirming that GPU memory is automatically freed when cuBVH variables die.
